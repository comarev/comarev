COMAREV is a therapy community that offers voluntary and transitory care for people with problems arising from the use and/or dependence of psychoactive substances.

## Description

The project's idea is to create the MVP of a system that allows Comarev's managers to manage the entity's contributors and partners, whose objective is to raise funds. The entity will look for stores and businesses for discounts for monthly contributors. The contributor will have access to an app and if they are up to date with the contribution, they can get discounted purchases from partners committed to a QR CODE through an app.
