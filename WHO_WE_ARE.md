## Origins

First of all, let's introduce what Comarev is. Comarev is a social project based in Batatais - SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Their goal is to offer an opportunity and a new life for drug addicts by giving them full support through sports, work out and psychological treatment FOR FREE. You can get more information [here](http://comarev.com.br/). During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, they lost some financial support from the government and had to come up with new ideas to raise money for the project because they have a lot of costs and serious professionals working there.
Monthly, the institution used to get some money from contributors, so they wanted to expand the number of contributors by offering some benefits such as discounts in local stores, supermarkets and so on. To make this possible, they needed a system to control everything. Immediately, we opened up a group on discord and started meeting weekly to study and develop the code to release a MVP as soon as possible. And we got it!
